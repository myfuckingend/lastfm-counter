# lastfm-counter
In-a-row track counter. Outputs top-20 scroobbling streaks for your account. Couldn't find such script anywhere so I decided to do it myself.
## How to install:
- Clone/download this repository
- Install requrements (pip install -r requirements.txt or PyCharm -> Preferences -> Project -> Python Interpreter -> install requests)
- Run the script
